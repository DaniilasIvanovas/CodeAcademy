Just a python project for file sorting on Windows 10.
Currently program sorts:
        .txt files
        .jpg files
        .png files
        .docx files
        .pptx files
        .xlsx files
        .pdf files
        .rar files
        .mp4 files
        .mov files
        .zip files
 
 As program starts, type in the directory in which you want to sort files path, and click button next to the field.
 
 After sorting files, it creates or updates history file "Edit history.txt"
